<v English>ï»¿1</v>
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
<v English>All right. So this is where things start to get</v>

2
00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.189
<v English>fun if you have not been having fun already.</v>

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.740
<v English>So what we are going to do now is build out this view.</v>

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.759
<v English>You will notice here that what we are doing is this is kind of like a live detailed view.</v>

5
00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.349
<v English>What we are doing is we are pulling information</v>

6
00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.209
<v English>from the phone in order to render this view.</v>

7
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.620
<v English>So it shows which way we are heading,</v>

8
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.780
<v English>the altitude, the current speed.</v>

9
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.140
<v English>All of this is going to be coming from your phone.</v>

10
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.429
<v English>So in order to do that, we actually need to go ahead and</v>

11
00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.300
<v English>use the phone's API to get that information.</v>

12
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.650
<v English>And one side note, if you are trying to do this on Android in the</v>

13
00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:31.664
<v English>simulator,is probably not going to work for some reason.</v>

14
00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.490
<v English>The Android simulator does not work with what we are doing,</v>

15
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:39.030
<v English>but if you have it on a actual real device using the Expo app, you will be fine.</v>

16
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.105
<v English>So you either forget about the Android emulator and use the Expo app</v>

17
00:00:42.104 --> 00:00:45.469
<v English>or the iOS simulator. All right. Let us jump into it.</v>

18
00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.640
<v English>So what we are going to do is,</v>

19
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.369
<v English>this new view is going to be called Live.js.</v>

20
00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:54.719
<v English>What we are going to have for now is</v>

21
00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.153
<v English>just react in a component and then we will import the View,</v>

22
00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:03.570
<v English>Text and this thing called ActivityIndicator,</v>

23
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.459
<v English>which are all coming from react-native.</v>

24
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:13.034
<v English>And then we will go ahead and export this class which extends component.</v>

25
00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.379
<v English>So what state this component is going to have,</v>

26
00:01:16.379 --> 00:01:20.155
<v English>it is going to have some coordinates which are set to null initially.</v>

27
00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:22.945
<v English>It is going to have a status which we will also set to</v>

28
00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:27.204
<v English>null and a direction which is just going to be an empty string.</v>

29
00:01:27.204 --> 00:01:34.030
<v English>So what we can do is we can grab this information off of the state.</v>

30
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.140
<v English>And then there are a few different views that we are going to get</v>

31
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.310
<v English>depending on the specific permissions that you are granted.</v>

32
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.564
<v English>So what we are going to say is if status equals null,</v>

33
00:01:45.564 --> 00:01:48.495
<v English>so the user really has not given us any permissions yet,</v>

34
00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:50.820
<v English>nothing has changed from the default state,</v>

35
00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:56.024
<v English>then what we want to do is render an ActivityIndicator,</v>

36
00:01:56.025 --> 00:01:59.160
<v English>and we will give it a margin top of 30.</v>

37
00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.729
<v English>All in ActivityIndicator is it's basically a loading spinners.</v>

38
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.670
<v English>So you've seen it before. It's just going render a spinner like,</v>

39
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.200
<v English>"Hey, we are waiting on something."</v>

40
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.770
<v English>If the status equals denied,</v>

41
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.880
<v English>meaning you asked for permission and they did not give it to you,</v>

42
00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:22.764
<v English>what we are going to do for now is just render a view with some text in that says denied,</v>

43
00:02:22.764 --> 00:02:35.615
<v English>and then we are going to do this exact same thing,</v>

44
00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:38.254
<v English>but instead of denied,</v>

45
00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:41.914
<v English>it is going to be for undetermined.</v>

46
00:02:41.914 --> 00:02:44.929
<v English>And when you are messing around with the simulator, again,</v>

47
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.790
<v English>some of these permissions are going to be a little bit</v>

48
00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.314
<v English>wonky because we are not on an actual real device,</v>

49
00:02:50.314 --> 00:02:53.375
<v English>but we will get to that when we get to that.</v>

50
00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:57.800
<v English>And then lastly, if it is not denied or undetermined,</v>

51
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.020
<v English>that means it was granted.</v>

52
00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.909
<v English>So what we will say is,</v>

53
00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.355
<v English>we will render a view,</v>

54
00:03:03.355 --> 00:03:05.329
<v English>and then for now,</v>

55
00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:08.965
<v English>what we are going to do is we will render a few text components.</v>

56
00:03:08.965 --> 00:03:11.120
<v English>We will just go ahead and show the state for now,</v>

57
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.849
<v English>and this looks pretty good.</v>

58
00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.875
<v English>So let us go ahead and add this as a new tab.</v>

59
00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:20.055
<v English>So inside of App.js,</v>

60
00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:21.800
<v English>first, we need to import it.</v>

61
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.915
<v English>And next, what we need to do is inside of tabs,</v>

62
00:03:25.914 --> 00:03:29.204
<v English>let us go ahead and add any property.</v>

63
00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:30.615
<v English>We will call it Live,</v>

64
00:03:30.615 --> 00:03:32.425
<v English>and just as we have done before,</v>

65
00:03:32.425 --> 00:03:36.210
<v English>screen is going to be the Live component.</v>

66
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:40.862
<v English>Some options here, the tabBarLabe,</v>

67
00:03:40.862 --> 00:03:43.055
<v English>we're just going to just say Live,</v>

68
00:03:43.055 --> 00:03:45.230
<v English>and then I am actually just going to copy</v>

69
00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:49.129
<v English>this one because we are also going to use Ionicon font,</v>

70
00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:56.305
<v English>but the name of this one is going to be ios-speedometer.</v>

71
00:03:56.305 --> 00:03:58.835
<v English>All right, let us see if this is working.</v>

72
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:01.180
<v English>So we got a Live.</v>

73
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.486
<v English>Notice, we get an indicator.</v>

74
00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:08.704
<v English>That is because the current status is set to null,</v>

75
00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:11.705
<v English>so we can just assume that this is working for sure.</v>

76
00:04:11.705 --> 00:04:13.670
<v English>We can set it to denied.</v>

77
00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:15.729
<v English>Now, what we should see it is denied up here.</v>

78
00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:17.327
<v English>All right. Let's set this back to null,</v>

79
00:04:17.327 --> 00:04:20.409
<v English>and we will continue building this out in future videos.</v>
